                <p>Compensation by job titles is only one aspect of the landscape in the area. This section is also meant to help employers better understand what benefits look like across the area as they’re trying to attract talent.</p>

                <p>We found that the experience of working somewhere can vary significantly based on the size and kind of company. Companies were defined in the following ways:</p>

                <p><strong>Company Size:</strong> <span class="code">startup or micro</span> (5-10 people), <span class="code">small</span> (11-50), <span class="code">mid-sized</span> (51-250), <span class="code">large</span> (251+)</p>

                <p><strong>Company Type:</strong> <span class="code">agency/consultancy</span> (company sells design/technical services) or <span class="code">in-house</span> (company makes/sells goods or sells non-design services)</p>

                <p>We recognize that there is a lot of nuance here, including categories such as non-profit and education work that were not within the scope of this first survey.</p>

                <p>Greater compensation closely aligned with size of company. We also saw greater compensation in in-house companies across the board, though there are still variances by role.</p>

                <h2>Opportunity for advancement</h2>

                <p>While compensation is important, it’s also important to understand if individuals feel they can advance in a company, ultimately leading to hire wages and career growth.</p>

                <p>When asked, “Do you feel that you have opportunities for advancement at your current job?” we noticed the least ambiguity in mid-sized companies. In general, we saw more confidence in agency/consultancy companies, perhaps because billing requires more adherence to a junior/intermediate/senior structure.</p>

                <p>We wanted a better understanding of the paid time off (“PTO”) policies, as PTO can represent a significant benefit.</p>

                <p>We observed the largest instance of unlimited PTO policies, where the company has no set number of days for vacation, at the mid-sized tier. Large and In-house companies both represent the most policies with a set number of days.</p>

                <p>PTO might be something worth some further exploration. Some respondents detailed that their policy is unlimited after hitting a certain threshold (number of years served), or unlimited with yearly requirements of hours. Several respondents wrote in that while their company’s PTO policy is “unlimited,” in practice it is actually limited.</p>
