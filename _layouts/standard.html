                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                <h4>What is the survey?</h4>
                <p>This is a project by <a href="/about">Dan, Tony, and Lauren</a>, three designers working in Philadelphia. Our goal is to raise the salary conversation for digital designers in the Philadelphia community so that we can <strong>better understand our worth</strong> and how we can <strong>advocate for our peers.</strong>
                </p>
                <h4>What will it look like?</h4>
                <p>The survey will ask for basic information about your current salary, benefits, and job responsibilities, as well as specific demographic information. These questions are required, but free response. We're asking for this information in order to build an understanding of the salary data when it comes to underrepresented minorities, and to discuss any notable pay disparities that may emerge across demographic lines.</p>
                <p><strong>All responses will be anonymous</strong> (more on that below). The survey should take about 15 minutes to complete.</p>

                <h4>How will the data be used?</h4>
                <p>Results will be presented largely in two sections:</p>
                <p><strong>Compensation Profiles:</strong> We'll be creating profiles from the data based on clusters of responsibilities, salary data, and experience level. You might expect to see profiles along the lines of "Entry-level (Agency)" or "In-house Design Lead."</p>
                <p><strong>Overall Trends:</strong> A critical part of this work is to understand disparity of salary and benefits across demographic groups. We expect to do a comparative analysis that will visualize trends that our design community should be aware of and work to correct.</p>
                <h4>How will my information be kept private?</h4>
                <p>We realize your salary is sensitive information. <strong>We will not:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Offer or share the raw data to anyone</li>
                    <li>Collect or store your name anywhere</li>
                    <li>Present data in any format that allows a single person's response to be identifable</li>
                    <li>Make any data available if groups do not meet a certain threshold (for example, five people who identify as X)</li>
                    <li>Keep any raw data after the final presentation is released</li>
                </ul>
