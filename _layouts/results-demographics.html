                <p>When looking at pay disparity, it is well-reported nationally that cisgender straight white men earn more than their counterparts across gender and racial/ethnic identities. We therefore did analysis of this majority against all other groups, such as “Men vs. Non-Men” and “White vs. Non-white.” (Read more about why we did this in our <a href="/philly/methodology#group-responses" title="Chapter: Methodoloy - Group Responses">methodology.)</a></p>

                <p>In almost all cases other than gender identity, the datasets we’re dealing with are very imbalanced: straight responses (219) represent over four times the number of other identities (53), likewise with white responses (208) versus other identities (64). It means that our averages are more susceptible to variation, and we’ve removed some with highly imbalanced datasets. In particular, while some findings here show no disparity or an average above the majority group, <strong>this does not in any way negate the experiences of individuals.</strong> Privilege is intersectional and manifests in many ways that are not represented by the questions we’ve asked.</p>

				<p>From the lens of compensation, these findings are meant to help us to focus and hone our efforts towards the most critical problems.</p>
